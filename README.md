Technical Test

Overview

Thank you for your interest in ARUTALA. In order for us to get a better understanding of your
technical abilities and how you fit into our team, we want you to complete the following
exercises.

We totally understand that you have limited time and your time is valuable, so we designed the
test to evaluate your abilities as quickly as we could, also to give you the opportunity to
demonstrate and explore the skills you have already developed and honed. If you are new to
the domains of these exercises we will however take that into account as well.

Please submit the exercises in Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket and share the link to us.

Good luck!
